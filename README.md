# Portfolio Webpage FreeCodeCamp

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/oNZmLQL](https://codepen.io/nstelmach/pen/oNZmLQL).

The goal of this project was to learn HTML and CSS. I focused on building a personal portfolio. I was supposed to use tags such as section, h1, a, navbar, and the corresponding id and classes. I also used media queries. In the future, I plan to refactor styles into classes using the BEM naming convention, use CSS Reset and increase accessibility by adding appropriate aria labels.
